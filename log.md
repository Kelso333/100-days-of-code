# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started an express app from scratch. 

**Thoughts:** The first time I learned Express it was a bit complex for me, but I'm excited to get the hang of it while I continue and practice with some courses and projects.

### Day 8: September 26, 2017

### Day 9: September 27, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: User is able to add a todo task, delete the task and complete the task. Completed tasks will be placed below the tasks that need to be completed. 

**Thoughts:** It was a great project because we used a lot of CSS techniques I've never used before (but have seen). We got into JS and I was excited. JS made a bit more sense here, but I still want to continue getting more hands on with JS.

### Day 10: September 29, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Added a few extra features and styling. The user knows there is a todo list and completed section. User can hit enter to submit a task. All tasks are in a data object and stored in local storage so tasks remain visible even when browser closes.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed seeing what JS can do and getting hands on. This video used a lot of pseudo in styling, which I haven't used as much; it did help to see it.

### Day 11: October 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started to play around with Express; building a small todo app without Express generator.

**Thoughts:** I know the fundamentals, but Express is something new to me. I will understand it as I practice and build projects with it.
