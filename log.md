# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started an express app from scratch. 

**Thoughts:** The first time I learned Express it was a bit complex for me, but I'm excited to get the hang of it while I continue and practice with some courses and projects.

### Day 2: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got customer names to show up and built a form.

### Day 3: September 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: User info is being saved, getting into database. Installed Express Validator.

**Thoughts:** Eventhough some of it makes sense, it's starting to get a little confusing. Need more repetition.

### Day 4: September 21, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Was able to add users to database and delete customers. Installed MongoJS.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to get into database and finish this small project. Need more repetition with Express.

### Day 5: September 22, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started a bookmark app. Used bootstrap template and JS.

### Day 6: September 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished app, and was able to successfully add a bookmark, visit the link, and delete the bookmark.
