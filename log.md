# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started an express app from scratch. 

**Thoughts:** The first time I learned Express it was a bit complex for me, but I'm excited to get the hang of it while I continue and practice with some courses and projects.

### Day 2: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got customer names to show up and built a form. 

**Thoughts:** It's making a bit more sense now. I'm loving it though. Feels good.

### Day 3: September 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: User info is being saved, getting into database. Installed Express Validator.

**Thoughts:** Eventhough some of it makes sense, it's starting to get a little confusing. Need more repetition.

### Day 4: September 21, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Was able to add users to database and delete customers. Installed MongoJS.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to get into database and finish this small project. Need more repetition with Express.

### Day 5: September 22, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started a bookmark app. Used bootstrap template and JS.

**Thoughts:** JS is making more sense now, but more repetition is needed.

### Day 6: September 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished app, and was able to successfully add a bookmark, visit the link, and delete the bookmark.

### Day 8: September 26, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Added svg files for buttons. Aligned todo list and added the remove button. 

**Thoughts:** I'm learning a lot of CSS skills, even though it seems a little confusing but it will connect. Still waiting to get started with JS.

### Day 8: September 27, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: User is able to add a todo task, delete the task and complete the task. Completed tasks will be placed below the tasks that need to be completed. 

**Thoughts:** It was a great project because we used a lot of CSS techniques I've never used before (but have seen). We got into JS and I was excited. JS made a bit more sense here, but I still want to continue getting more hands on with JS.

### Day 8: September 29, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Added a few extra features and styling. The user knows there is a todo list and completed section. User can hit enter to submit a task. All tasks are in a data object and stored in local storage so tasks remain visible even when browser closes.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed seeing what JS can do and getting hands on. This video used a lot of pseudo in styling, which I haven't used as much; it did help to see it.
