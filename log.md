# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started an express app from scratch. 

**Thoughts:** The first time I learned Express it was a bit complex for me, but I'm excited to get the hang of it while I continue and practice with some courses and projects.

### Day 3: September 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: User info is being saved, getting into database. Installed Express Validator.

**Thoughts:** Eventhough some of it makes sense, it's starting to get a little confusing. Need more repetition.

### Day 4: September 21, 2017
